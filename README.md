# GenQAOA
GenQAOA is a MATLAB-based library used to study the (generalized) quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA).

## Usage

1) navigate to GenQAOA/MATLAB directory
2) run the initialize.m script to add various subdirectories to MATLAB's path
3) run your script (for example, navigate to GenQAOA/MATLAB/demo and run a demo script)

### Explanation of library organization

MATLAB/Classical - classical algorithms for solving combinatorial optimization problems (serving as comparison)

MATLAB/QAOA - functions that simulate quantum ciruits for various (generalized) QAOA 

MATLAB/QA - functions related to quantum annealing or adiabatic algorithm

MATLAB/demo - demo scripts that utilize the library 

MATLAB/experiments - some experimental code used by the author for pet projects (use at your own risk)

MATLAB/graphutils - various functions that help create and analyze graph objects

MATLAB/utils - various utility functions (e.g. efficient creation of kronecker products)
